### What are supply chain management problems

- **Lack of Automation and Reliance on Human Work**:Excessive manual processes and paperwork lead to errors, delays, and inefficiencies throughout the supply chain.

- **Lack of Trust, Transparency, and Data Sharing**: Insufficient transparency between suppliers and companies, combined with siloed data systems and lack of information sharing, can lead to mistrust, fraudulent activities, disputes, quality issues, miscommunication, delays, and conflicts throughout the supply chain.

- **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**:Centralized systems are vulnerable to cyber attacks, which can disrupt the entire supply chain and lead to data breaches.

- **Inefficient Asset Management**:Complex asset tracking and multiple intermediaries can result in delays, errors, increased costs, and ownership disputes.
