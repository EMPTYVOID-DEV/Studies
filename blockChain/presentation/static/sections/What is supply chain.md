### Supply chain

A supply chain is the interconnected network of organizations, activities, and resources involved in the creation and distribution of a product or service, from the initial sourcing of raw materials to the final delivery to the consumer.

#### The key components of a supply chain typically include:

- **Suppliers**: These are the entities that provide raw materials, components, or services necessary for the production process.
- **Manufacturers**: They transform raw materials into finished products through various production processes.
- **Distributors**: They are responsible for storing, transporting, and delivering the finished products to retailers or end customers.
- **Retailers**: They are the final touchpoint with consumers, selling the products directly to the end-users.
- **Logistics**: This encompasses the transportation, warehousing, and material handling activities required to move goods along the supply chain.


### Supply chain management

Supply Chain Management (SCM) refers to the coordination and integration of these various components and activities involved in the supply chain. Effective SCM aims to streamline the flow of products, information, and finances across the entire supply chain network, from raw material procurement to final distribution.

The main objectives of Supply Chain Management include:

- **Cost Optimization**: Reducing operational costs through efficient sourcing, production, and distribution processes.
- **Quality Control**: Ensuring product quality and consistency throughout the supply chain.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifying and mitigating potential risks, such as supply disruptions, quality issues, or regulatory compliance challenges.
- **Responsiveness**: Adapting to changes in customer demand, market conditions, or supply fluctuations.
