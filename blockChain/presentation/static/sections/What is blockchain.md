### Blockchain

Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed digital ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers (nodes) in a network. It is essentially a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are securely linked together using cryptography.

#### Some key features and characteristics of blockchain technology include:

- **Decentralization**: Instead of relying on a central authority or intermediary, blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network, where each node maintains a copy of the ledger, ensuring transparency and eliminating the need for a trusted third party.
- **Immutability**: Once data (transactions) is recorded in a block and added to the blockchain, it becomes extremely difficult to alter or tamper with, providing a high degree of data integrity and security.
- **Transparency**: All transactions on the blockchain are visible to all participants, ensuring transparency and enabling auditing of the entire transaction history.
- **Security**: Blockchain leverages advanced cryptographic techniques, such as hash functions and digital signatures, to secure the network and validate transactions, making it resistant to fraud and cyber attacks.



### Smart contracts

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. These contracts are stored and replicated on a blockchain network and automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met.


### Oracles

Oracles are third-party services that act as bridges between blockchains and external data sources or systems. They provide smart contracts with access to off-chain data and events, which are necessary for executing certain contract conditions or triggering specific actions.


### Chainlink

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that aims to provide smart contracts with secure and reliable access to off-chain data and computations. It is designed to solve the "oracle problem," which refers to the challenge of securely connecting blockchain-based smart contracts with external data sources and systems.
